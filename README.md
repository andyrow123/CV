I have always had a fascination for technology and how thinks work and from an early age this translated into coding. 
Whether it was to solve a problem, make a process at work easier, or just to pass the time, coding has always been a big part of my life. 
Making it a career has always been a goal and Makers Academy is another step toward that goal. 

In in my previous company I demonstrated an attention to detail and the ability to meet targets. 
My team oversaw multiple high profile clients, all with time sensitive needs that required an ability to problem solve under pressure.
